#This readme file will explain about this test framwork
#Author: Awadhesh Jha : 12-Oct-2018

The Original directory 'Awadhesh_testAPI'or zip/tar after extraction it  contains two directories ( bash-weather-test  and QA_test )to test openweathermap API
The Test framework designed in bash and curl language/scripting
All script have details within script how to run and more details can be get from README file
The test architecture designed to test all API which are on openweathermap current weather page


Awadhesh_testAPI
   bash-weather-test  
      
	  bash-weather.sh --> This script is the master script which call other scripts and give you result
	                  --> You need to get API key from openweathermap.org
					  --> This framework covered all API test functionalities from 'https://openweathermap.org/current'
	                  --> This script can execute like ' ./bash-weather.sh  -t City Name -c Country'
					  --> Steps by steps prerequition written in REDME file in same directory please check
					  --> This script can execute like  Example' ./bash-weather.sh  -t Delhi -c India'
					  --> After execution script you will see result as temperature on screen only'
					  --> This program keeps refreshing and display results always'
					  --> Once you execute this program then you see result on screen and by pressing key 'c' you can change unit
					  --> To change unit from C to F or F to C you have to press key (c)
					  --> All instruction you can see on screen output
					  --> To exit from program/screen you have to press 'ctrl + c' if key (q) does not work fine
					  --> You can pass any citi name name along country and it will give you current weather report from openweathermap.org
					  --> This script calling other rest scripts which are present in this directory
					  --> All scripts are having own scope i have assigned script name as per scope to get idea
					  --> For more debug or to understand please open each file and get the idea
	  create-buffer.sh
	  get-weather-data.sh 
	  openweathermap.key 
	  print-help.sh  
	  print-weather-condition.sh

   QA_test
       bin --> All scripts are under bin directory

         --> In this directory i ahve created all Test scripts which will test all API functionalities from https://openweathermap.org/current page
		 --> This directory contains many scripts each script can run individually
		 --> All scripts is having steps how to execute on the top of script also i have mentioned below all execution steps along Script name.
         --> You might need to install 'jq' for print json details in some script i ahve used so it needed to be pre-installed 		 

		Sanity_test_Unit_C.sh

			# This script will cover to check Sanity level of testing for all functionalities of openweathermap current weather API in unit C
			# This is for test/Verify the openweathermap API
			# Please add your city name which you want to test in citi_name variable list
			# To Run this test You have to come on directory where this script resides and execute as './Sanity_test_Unit_C.sh
			# Test result for current weather report for openweathermap you can see on terminal itself and also it stor in log file as well which you can find on ../logs/
			# On new run existing log will deleted and new log will be created also  in ../logs/ you can see city wise log as well and master also
			# Enable below if you are extracting entire directory to your home directory then  do pwd and set that path to QA_HOME

		Test_weather_parameter.sh
			# This test is for to test city along country name, you have to pass city name with option along country name below is the exaample of run
			# Please run indivisualy this scripts as './Test_weather_parameter.sh'
			# If are interested to run with argument passing along base script the run as ' bash ../../bash-weather-test/bash-weather.sh -t London -c UK
			# In this script i have hardcode  city name and country names for testing purpose
			# If want to pass any city and country name which is not hdded as variable then
			# Go to test directory where 'bash-weather.sh' available then you have to run only ./bash-weather.sh along options (exmple: ./bash-weather.sh -t London -c UK )
			# Please increase sleep time value if api is responding in a minutes or more based on that you change then you will get data
			#If it write empty output fropm API then increase sleep time valeue after script executed

	Logs --> All script execution script will store under logs directory for being huge logs i am keeping removing if you wish to store 
	         please comment the remove command in scripts.
			 
	config --> I have created config directory as a part of test framwork to configure any files or any environment details can be set it here
	
	Lib --> All required libraries can be placed here like any package it required like Json tool,Java, or any library which required.
